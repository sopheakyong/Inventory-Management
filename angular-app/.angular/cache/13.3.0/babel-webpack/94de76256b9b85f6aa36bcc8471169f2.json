If however you set delay to `0`, `asap` will wait for current synchronously executing\n * code to end and then it will try to execute given task as fast as possible.\n *\n * `asap` scheduler will do its best to minimize time between end of currently executing code\n * and start of scheduled task. This makes it best candidate for performing so called \"deferring\".\n * Traditionally this was achieved by calling `setTimeout(deferredTask, 0)`, but that technique involves\n * some (although minimal) unwanted delay.\n *\n * Note that using `asap` scheduler does not necessarily mean that your task will be first to process\n * after currently executing code. In particular, if some task was also scheduled with `asap` before,\n * that task will execute first.
